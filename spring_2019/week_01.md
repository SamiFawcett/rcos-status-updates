## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I was able to resolve an issue with removing a past assignment. I added removing options to both an easier to access
> location on a table (fewer clicks) and on the specific past assignment page (more clicks)

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on to find and fix an issue I want to fix on our github's issues page.

## Anything Blocking?

> First round of tests are this week, most of my time is spent preparing for them.
> Knowledge block, I'm not familiar with most of the front end syntax, but it isn't hard to understand.
